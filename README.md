Data analysis using simpson integral with Python

This code was written for a scientific study where the objective was to observe how much better the new samples were compared to the standard samples.

For that, two spreadsheets were used, a standard spreadsheet and a spreadsheet with the new values ​​of the tested samples.

The interest was in the difference between the values ​​of the integrals obtained from the tested samples and from the standard values.

The graph resulting from the code helps to analyze the data.
